According to me Doubly Linked List will be best choice to implement Stack and Queue Together

Pros:
    It will allow push() or enqueue() operation by appending the element to the list in constant time.
    It will allow pop() by removing the last element in constant time
    It will allow dequeue() by removing the first element, also in constant time.

Cons:
    Increased Space, extra space to store the address of previous node
