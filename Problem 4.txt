Array List:

    ArrayList holds indexed references to every element in the list, so it can get the n-th element in constant time O(1). 
    Deletion is slower in ArrayList as it has to shift all the elements after the element is Deleted

LinkedList:
    Linked List has to traverse the data, that results in ploynomial time i.e O(n)
    Linked can perform deletion in a linear time (O(1)), however O(n) time is needed to traverse the LinkedList
